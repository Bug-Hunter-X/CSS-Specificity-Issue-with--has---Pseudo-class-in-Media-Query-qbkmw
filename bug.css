The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `:has()` pseudo-class within a media query. The issue lies in the specificity of the selectors and how the browser handles them across different screen sizes.  The intended behavior is for the `.container` class to have a red background when it contains an element with the class `.item`, but only when the screen width is less than 768px. However, due to specificity conflicts, this might not always work as expected.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container:has(.item) {
    background-color: red;
  }
}

.container {
  background-color: blue;
  padding: 20px;
}

.item {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: green;
}
```
